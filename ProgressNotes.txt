We need to finish the admin controls.

Everything is ready, we just need to finish the approveReview and deleteReview methods in the js script.
These should call a php script which uses the DAO to make the changes, you know the drill.

Approvals = set approved to 1.
Deletions = nuke the record.

This hopefully wont take too long. After this is done we need to migrate the install to the edward2 server via filezilla. Perform an end to end test.

After that is done, all thats left is the review. We have most of friday to do that, but if we can make a start on it tommorow well be in a good place.
